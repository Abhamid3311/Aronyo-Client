    title: "How often should orchids be watered?",
    details:
      "Most orchids need the same watering routine. In the winter, they only need water once per week. As the weather warms, they need water twice per week. An orchid in a larger pot will need water less frequently than an orchid in a smaller pot. Pay attention to the moss around your orchid. When it dries, your orchid needs water.",

    details:
      "Orchids are elegant flowers with a unique asymmetrical design. While they look like complicated flowers to care for, they are easy to keep alive and thriving. Some orchids only bloom for a short time, so their limited flowering time makes them special to those who enjoy them.People who live in chilly climates, but vacation in tropical ones, tend to consider orchids pleasant reminders of their time away from home. Whatever the reason, orchids tend to bring a sense of joy to the spaces they occupy.",
